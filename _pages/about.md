## 🔍About Me
I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Bioinformatics at Tongji University. In 2026, I will join the Cheng Li Lab at the School of Life Sciences, Peking University, to pursue my Ph.D. degree.

## 🌟Research Interests
My current research focuses on mass spectrometry–based single-cell proteomics data analysis and its application to elucidating the mechanisms of atherosclerosis. Broadly, I am interested in developing deep learning–based multi-omics integration algorithms tailored for single-cell proteomics data.
